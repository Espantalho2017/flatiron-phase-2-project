# Trade Study Matrix

## Description

This Flatiron Phase 2 Project creates a trade study matrix application to help the user to perform a trade analysis of 2 options by allowing the user to input information relevant to that user for each of those 2 options and then to subjectively and objectively "trade" which 1 of those 2 option is the best option for that user to choose. The "Trade" will be subjectively or objectively what the user thinks is important to trade to determine what the best 1 option out of the 2 for that user should be. The "Grade" will initially always be a number determined by the user. These "Grades" will be added accross the the "Trades" for these 2 different trade options and the maximum calculated number for the summed "Grade" will be the best 1 option out of the 2 options. A database will hold an example trade study scenario to display to the user so the user has a visual example of how to use this trade study matrix application to their benefit. This database will also save the trade study that the user created.

## Installation

This project was installed in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript using the REACT Framework for JavaScript.

## Usage

Trade analysis is used by people everyday to attempt to make rational decisions about which option or path or decision is the best when presented with information about alternative options. Buying a car is a trade analysis of what is the best car (as an option) to purchase. Trade study matrixes are used by engineering professionals to document why one option was selected amongst multiple options.

## Roadmap

In the future releases of this webapplicationsite, "Weight Percentage" and "Notes" Child Components may be added to present more detail and information to this trade study matrix for the user to view. The formatting and aesthetics of this application will also be improved.

I need to run 
npm start
and
npm run server
when I start up each time anew or after I hit Control-C
You have to hit the + button to create a split terminal or the side-by-side button and then type npm start and npm run server separately into each window to get them started

I added the below code to my package.json:

I need to run the below 
npm run server

the code above runs the code below
    "server": "json-server --watch db.json --port 3030" ,
