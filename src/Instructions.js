        This Trade Study Matrix Application (App) enables
        the user to input 2 options that they want to
        "trade" which enables the user to visually figure out
        which of those 2 options is the best option for them.
        There is an Example Trade page on this App that shows 
        the user what a trade might look like. Input the 
        2 options that you want to trade on the home page and
        5 trades that you would make to determine which of those 
        2 options is best for you. Add number grades for each of
        your 5 trades for each of your 2 options. The App will
        then show you your trade study matrix for your 2 options.
